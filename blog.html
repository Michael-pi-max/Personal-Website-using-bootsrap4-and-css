                <h5 class="card-title">How do software engineers spend there day?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">If you’re beginning your career in software development, you may wonder what your
                    typical day as a programmer or engineer might look like. Of course, a lot of factors impact the
                    average day for a software developer—are you a freelancer or a full-time employee? Are you working
                    for a start-up or an established corporation?

                    It is really hard to describe a typical day as a Software Engineer because when your daily work is
                    creating products that can solve problems for millions of people across the globe, you cannot have a
                    “typical” day. Every day is a new challenge.</p>

            <p>
                If there is one thing most developers have in common, it has to be the fact that they sometimes lack
                motivation. And no wonder. The projects most developers have to engage in often times take a toll on
                them. So how can we deal with the pressure? How can we reignite our passion for coding? What if we could
                do that through something we all love to do, Watch Movies.
            </p>
            <h5>SILICON VALLEY</h5>
            <p>
                If you want to understand Silicon Valley, watch Silicon Valley — Bill Gates
                If you are a programmer and you haven’t seen this movie then I urge you to take time and watch it.
                Silicon Valley is an American comedy series about a small team of developers at an Internet startup
                called Pied Piper. You watch them struggle to figure out their strategy, build their product, raise
                money, and take on Hooli, the tech giant that bears an obvious but superficial resemblance to Google or
                Microsoft.
                It is an amazing movie suited for developers aiming to build a tech-based company one day.</p>
            <h5>THE SOCIAL NETWORK</h5>
            <p>
                Facebook, heard of it? Well, this movie talks about the journey (though some details were added for
                kicks) of the popular social network. The Social Network is believed to be based on true events for the
                most part, although Mark Zuckerberg has publicly disputed aspects of the movie in real life.</p>
            <h5>Jobs</h5>
            Yet another movie about Steve Jobs. College dropout Steve Jobs is largely the iconic name and face of Apple
            Computers, a company he co-founded.
            The biography of the legend in the world of computers Steve jobs an inspirational movie every programmer
            should watch. Jobs serves as an inspiration to fellow youngsters and elders alike. This movie not just
            depicts the technical genius in Jobs, but also his creative entrepreneurship and his commitment to his
            vision of changing the world.

            <h3 class="topic">Web Development</h3>
            <p>
                There are two broad divisions of web development – front-end development (also called client-side
                development) and back-end development (also called server-side development).

                Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application – the
                content, design and how you interact with it. This is done with three codes – HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

                HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a special code for ‘marking up’ text in order to turn it
                into a web page. Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it will form the backbone of any web
                application. CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a code for setting style rules for the appearance
                of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic side of the web. Finally, JavaScript is a scripting language
                that’s widely used to add functionality and interactivity to web pages.

                Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of a web application. A back-end often uses
                a database to generate the front-end.
            </p>
            <h5>Ways to Learn Web Development</h5>
            <p>
                The are plenty ways to learn either to enroll in a university or trade school course.
                However, it can be costly – and what’s more, the web evolves so fast that schools often can’t keep up!

                Luckily, there’s plenty of good quality coding training available here on the Internet. What better
                place to learn web development than the web itself?

                A particular training recommendation is Treehouse. This is because it has a focus on web development, is
                recommended by many of the world’s most trusted and recognized web developers (such as Chris Coyier) and
                most of its teachers are themselves web developers.</p>

            <p>
                We don’t look at things, we don’t zoom out and look at the bigger picture. We don’t zoom out and
                actually look at things as a whole with a greater perspective.

                See, when you’re walking on the streets in the city next to buildings, they all look the same height.
                You can’t tell the difference. But then when you’re flying in a plane, you can see the difference
                between the taller and shorter buildings.

                Everything gets into perspective.

                When we’re too zoom in into the details and the minute points, we don’t see everything. When we zoom out
                and take a bird’s eye view and step back from our lives, we gain a greater perspective.

                I hope this has changed your perspective today.

            <h3 class="topic">Software engineer life</h3>
            <p>
                With a projected 24 percent growth by 2026, the software engineering field boasts impressive job
                prospects. If you’re interested in coding, software engineering is an industry you should consider, but
                what do software engineers really do?

                A day in the life of a software engineer is ever-changing. While there are definite trends across the
                profession, the truth is that software engineers can work just about anywhere. From design companies, to
                finance, to manufacturing, software engineers are needed across the board, and that’s exactly what makes
                this career path so hot.

                No matter where you’re working, there are a few software engineering tasks that are a given. One of them
                is designing code in some capacity. Another is testing projects and analyzing code for your specific
                industry. Above all, software engineers working for a company will enjoy being part of a team. There’s
                always something to be gained by putting heads together, which is something HackReactor at Galvanize
                prioritizes in our software engineering courses.
